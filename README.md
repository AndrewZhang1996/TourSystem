TourSystem
--------------------------------------------------------

This is a scenic spot management system.

This system have two types of users which are administrators and common users.

Functions of administrators:
- registration
- add/remove scenic spot
- add/remove roads between spots
- broadcasting
Functions of common users:
- query map
- query scenic spots
- query shortest path between two spots
- query complete tour path between two spots
- query broadcasting messages

This system can have different administrators and each administrator has different signs to login.

This system is my data structure assignment in the university.
